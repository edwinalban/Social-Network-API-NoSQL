# Social-Network-API-NoSQL
API for a social network using MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express

Creates a database for allowing Users to connect by posting their thoughts and reactions with regard to information, and manages their freinds lists.

## Description

I built this project in order to practice using NoSQL databases and queries to view, add, and edit/delete information. I learned about MongoDB/Mongoose queries, the use of controllers to create endpoints for routes, the difference between a Model and a Schema, documents and subdocuments in MongoDB.
